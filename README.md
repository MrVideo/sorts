# Sorts

## A collection of sorting algorithms written in C

This is a small collection of C programs to explain the most common sorting algorithms and their time complexity.
Each program contains a random number generator to fill an array that will then be ordered and printed.

## Compilation

I used a custom header file to avoid rewriting the same functions over and over, so, to compile a specific program, use the shell command:

```shell
clang -o filename filename.c array_functions.c
```

## Library

You can use the library I included in this repository in your project. Make sure you include it in your code and use it according to the [license](https://github.com/MrVideo/sorts/blob/main/LICENSE) provided with the repository.
